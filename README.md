# Keystone 4 Command Line Interface

A quick and easy CLI To get you up and running with a new [keystone](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keystone) project. Currently it generates a version of the [minimum viable keystone](https://github.com/Noviny/minimum-viable-keystone) package, pulling in only the files you need.

```
npm install -g kescli
```

From there run

```
kescli NEW_PROJECT_NAME
```

and it will make you a working version of a base keystone 4 app in a new directory of the specified project name.

This is intended to compliment the [keystone generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-keystone), as a more lightweight package when you want to manually do the configuration.
